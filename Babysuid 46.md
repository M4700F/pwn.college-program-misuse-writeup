`dmseg` is a display message command that display kernel-related messages on Unix-like OS.

Read the `man dmseg`. 

> [!NOTE]
> The kernel buffer is a memory storage used for keeping the log messages of the kernel. It's a ring buffer with a fixed size. Once it's full, new messages overwrite the oldest messages. That's why it is called `ring`.

I searched through the `man dmseg` about `file`. I found one. It says:

`-F, --file file : Read the syslog messages from the given file.`

Welcome to /challenge/babysuid_level46!

This challenge is part of a series of programs that
just straight up were not designed to let you read files.

I just set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/dmesg.
Try to use it to read the flag!

IMPORTANT: make sure to run me (/challenge/babysuid_level46) every time that you restart
this challenge container to make sure that I set the SUID bit on /usr/bin/dmesg!
