Hello! Welcome to the write-up of `pwn.college - Program Misuse` challenges. 

In this write-up, I try not only to write the solutions but also write the meaning of the each
command in a short form, other approaches to solve, some insights of the problem. You will find them later in the challenges mostly as the first few challenges is super easy. 

I also recommend to watch the three lectures that are attached to this module and also request you try the problem first by yourselves and then see the write-ups.

Also in some problems, Some questions came to my mind that I didn't find the answers yet. I will try to find those in the future and include them here.

Here is the link of the module:
